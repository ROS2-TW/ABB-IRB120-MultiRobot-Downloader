# ABB_MultiBot_Feedback_Project

This repository will be a workground for a number of things to support a multi-robot ABB IRB120 experiment. A TBD force/torque sensor and visual segmentation work will be completed for feedback on the robots motion planner. 

This repository will also act as a staging ground for my updated ABB_Drivers package which will enable 2 or more robots to interact in ROS with a single IRC5 controller. Setup instructions for how to setup multiple robots and changes to the ROS-I abb_driver will be included.
